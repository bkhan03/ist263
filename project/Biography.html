Khan first started his electronic dance music adventure with his brother, who had introduced him to the Swedish House Mafia. After figuring other genres of EDM, Khan eventually stumbled across techno. After gaining inspiration from artists such as Carl Cox, Hot Since 82, Mark Knight, and many more, Khan finally found his passion for the music. With coming to college Khan hopes to have an explosive year in growth for his following and to finally play at a festival.
