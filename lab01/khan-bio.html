    Hello my name is Baber Khan but you can call me Khan. 
    I'm a Information and Technology major interseted in computers since a young age.
    I know how to build a desktop and on track to complete the AWS course from Amazon by completing classes online.
    Outside of work and school I am a music producer and DJ. I have always loved djing since I was in the third grade. 
    And now I am currently waiting to release my new tracks coming this spring to start my music portfolio.
    Lastly, I am a native New Yorker so I do love my New York style pizza
